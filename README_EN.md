### Border Hustle
_________________

A tycoon game created in Unity where the player assumes the role of a smuggler who has to smuggle as much goods across the border as possible. In the game, the player has to manage their business, buy new vehicles, hire workers, upgrade vehicles, and buy new ones to replace those that have been confiscated in failed smuggling operations. During the Jam, I was responsible for refining the gameplay idea, game design, economic balance, creating assets, and finally preparing the promotional material visible below.

### Remember How You Die
_________________

FPS prepared during the 24-hour Space Jam 2022 - organized by the GSA UJ circle - the theme of which was **_memory_**.

In the game, we play as a character who must fight against time and use their memory.

**My role in the project:**
In this project, I was the team leader and the creator of the idea for the entire game that would be consistent with the theme of the jam, and I was responsible for the assets. The gameplay idea was simple. An FPS where the player is supposed to die, but dying helps them complete the level. When the player dies, they remember the enemy (the enemy is highlighted through the wall), which helps them target enemies faster. The time to complete the level is limited, so the player has to quickly try to run through it and not wait for the enemies.

The game is available on my repository [github.com](https://github.com/Tymiec/Battleships/releases/tag/v0.9.1)

### GBall
_________________

A game on the Unity engine in which we are a ball that has to get through levels, avoiding obstacles or using boosts scattered around the map to get further. Made mainly with the thought of learning the New Input System and Unity engine physics but also served to learn the new UI Toolkit for creating menus. I'm currently waiting for inspiration to create interesting levels for it.

### Superposition
_________________

A logic game using quantum physics and is in the closed testing phase. It will be released on Steam in the future. Currently, I am responsible for testing the game, creating levels, and assisting in making decisions related to game development.
